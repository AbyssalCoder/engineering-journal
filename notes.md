## Fibonacci Sequence

### Iterative approach

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=' ')
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

**Key takeaway:** The iterative version runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.

## File Handling in Python

```python
# Writing
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, file!\n')
    f.write('Second line\n')

# Reading
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Always use `with` statements — they handle closing automatically.
